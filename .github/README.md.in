# GRDB + SQLCipher 

## What is this?
This is a fork of [GRDB](https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift) which contains a [SQLCipher Community Edition](https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/open-source/) amalgamation packaged so that it can be consumed as a Swift Package.

The default branch for this repository is `SQLCipher` so that we can more easily pull upstream changes if we need to.

## Versioning

* This Package: *${new_version}*
* GRDB: *${upstream_version}*
* SQLCipher: *${sqlcipher_version}*

## Contributions
We do not accept contributions to this repository at this time.  However, feel free to open an issue in order to start a discussion.

## We are hiring!
DuckDuckGo is growing fast and we continue to expand our fully distributed team. We embrace diverse perspectives, and seek out passionate, self-motivated people, committed to our shared vision of raising the standard of trust online.

## Updating from Upstream

Add remote upstream:

* `git remote add upstream git@github.com:groue/GRDB.swift.git`

Check out upstream's master branch locally:

* `git fetch upstream +master:upstream-master && git checkout upstream-master`

Update upstream's master branch if needed:

* `git pull upstream master`

Switch back to the `SQLCipher` branch and merge with upstream-master:

* `git merge upstream-master`

Resolve any conflicts that may occur (normally there should be none or only in Package.swift)
and commit the merge. Once done, run `prepare_release.sh` script to fetch and compile the latest tag
of SQLCipher and embed it in GRDB.swift:

* `./prepare_release.sh`

The script will also:
* present the summary of updated versions and ask you to pick the new version number for DuckDuckGo GRDB fork,
* test the build,
* create a new release branch and commit changes.

For versioning, follow [Semantic Versioning Rules](https://semver.org), but note you don't need
to use the same version as GRDB. Examples:

* Upstream GRDB 5.6.0, after merge -> 5.12.0
  * This project 1.0.0 -> 1.1.0

* Upstream GRDB 5.12.0, after merge -> 6.0.0
  * This project 1.1.0 -> 2.0.0

If everything looks fine, push your branch, create PR for BSK referencing your new branch,
and then create PRs for iOS and macOS apps referencing your BSK branch.

Once merged, tag the branch with a version picked earlier and push the tag.

### Compiling SQLCipher manually

In case `prepare_release.sh` script fails, you need to compile SQLCipher amalgamation package
manually. See [general instructions](https://github.com/sqlcipher/sqlcipher#compiling-for-unix-like-systems):

* Use `./configure --with-crypto-lib=none`.
* Remember to use `make sqlite3.c` and not `make`.
* Copy `sqlite3.c` and `sqlite3.h` to `Sources/SQLCipher/sqlite3.c` and `Sources/SQLCipher/include/sqlite3.h`.
